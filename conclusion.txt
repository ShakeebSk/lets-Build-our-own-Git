By this we have done the testing of all the features 

usage: git.py [-h] {init,add,commit,checkout,branch,log,status,merge,cherry-pick,stash,tag,reset,diff} ...

all of the above are completed 

now feel free to add any new feature if u want 
and probably there are lot edge cases that w can handle
