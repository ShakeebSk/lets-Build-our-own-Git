PyGit - A Simple Git Clone in Python

📖 What is PyGit?
PyGit is a Python implementation of Git that demonstrates the core concepts and internals of version control systems. This project is for educational purposes to understand how Git works under the hood by implementing the fundamental data structures and operations.

Core Components
1. GitObject Class
Base class for all Git objects (Blob, Tree, Commit)
Handles serialization/deserialization with zlib compression
Generates SHA-1 hashes for object identification (real Git uses SHA-256 nowadays)
2. Blob Objects
Store actual file contents
Represent individual files in the repository
3. Tree Objects
Represent directory structures
Store references to blobs and other trees
Maintain file permissions and names
4. Commit Objects
Store metadata about commits (author, timestamp, message)
Reference tree objects and parent commits
Form the commit history chain
5. Repository Class
Manages the .git directory structure
Handles object storage and retrieval
Implements Git commands (init, add, commit, checkout, etc.)
Features
Repository Initialization - Create new Git repositories
File Staging - Add files to the staging area
Commit Creation - Create commits with messages and metadata
Branch Management - Create, switch, and delete branches
Commit History - View commit logs and history
Status Checking - Monitor repository state
Object Storage - Efficient storage using SHA-1 hashing and compression

📦 Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
No external dependencies required (uses standard libraries only)
Quick Start
# Clone the repository
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd git_clone

# Run PyGit commands
python3 main.py init
python3 main.py add README.md
python3 main.py commit -m "Initial commit"
💻 Usage Examples
Initialize a Repository
python3 main.py init
# Output: Initialized empty Git repository in ./.git
Add Files to Staging
# Add single file
python3 main.py add main.py

# Add entire directory
python3 main.py add src/

# Add multiple files
python3 main.py add file1.py file2.py src/
Create Commits
python3 main.py commit -m "Add new feature"
python3 main.py commit -m "Fix bug" --author "Shakeeb Shaikh <shakeeb@shaikh.com>"
Branch Operations
# List branches
python3 main.py branch

# Create new branch
python3 main.py checkout -b feature-branch

# Switch to existing branch
python3 main.py checkout main

# Delete branch
python3 main.py branch feature-branch -d
View Repository Status
# Check working directory status
python3 main.py status

# View commit history
python3 main.py log -n 5

🔍 How It Works
1. Object Storage
Files are stored as Blob objects with compressed content
Directories are represented as Tree objects with file references
Each object gets a unique SHA-1 hash
2. Staging Process
Files are read and converted to Blob objects
Object hashes are stored in the index (staging area)
Index tracks which files are ready for commit
3. Commit Process
Creates a Tree object from the current index
Generates a Commit object with metadata
Updates branch reference to point to new commit
4. Branch Management
Branches are just files pointing to commit hashes
Checkout updates HEAD and restores working directory
Branch creation copies current commit reference
